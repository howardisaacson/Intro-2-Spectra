# Intro-2-Spectra
A Series of Tutorials for analyzing high-resolution optical spectra

Topics:
 * Opening fits files and headers of reduced spectra and wavelength solutions
 * Opening and understanding raw spectra (bias, trace, dispersion vs cross-dispersion direction), sky projection
 * Normalization and blaze function removal
 * Identifying sky emission lines, equilibrium(photospheric) features vs non-equilibrium features.
 * Signal to noise estimates from both raw and reduced spectra.
